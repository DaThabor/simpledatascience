    "## Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "Like other correlation coefficients, the point biserial ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 is no relationship and 1 is a perfect relationship.\n",

    "Graphs showing a correlation of -1, 0 and +1\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Cautions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    *If you intentionally force data to become binary so that you can run point biserial correlation, perhaps by splitting continuous ratio variables into two segments, it will make your results less reliable. There are exceptions to this rule of thumb. For example, you could separate test scores or GPAs into pass/fail, creating a logical binary variable. An example unnaturally forcing a scale into a binary variable: saying that people under 5’9″ are “Short” and over 5’9″ are “tall.”\n",
    "    One assumption for this test is that the variables are randomly independent. Therefore, the point biserial shouldn’t be used to analyze experimental results; use Linear Regression with dummy variables instead.\n"
